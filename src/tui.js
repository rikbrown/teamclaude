   *  paths — reordering `am.accounts` would silently repoint every one of them
   *  at a different account. So the rows are sorted by a field instead, and
   *  each account keeps the slot it has held since startup.
   *
   *  It is not `priority` either. That field is rotation preference, and a
   *  fleet usually carries one non-default value there — a deliberately
   *  deprioritised backend, say. Deriving it from where a row sits on screen
   *  would re-rank rotation as a side effect of tidying the display, which is a
   *  routing change nobody asked for.
   *
   *  Every arrangeable account is renumbered from its new position rather than

   *  insert between, and a dense 0..n-1 is the form that reads in a hand-edited

   *  by provider before it reads this field, so swapping numbers with a
   *  neighbour from the other provider would rewrite the config while no row
   *  moved. The locally-served rows are already out of reach: _arrangeable
