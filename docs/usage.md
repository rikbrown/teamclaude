# Usage

Running the server, running Claude Code through it, and the full command reference.

## Start the proxy server

```bash
teamclaude server
```

From a TTY this shows the interactive TUI: an account table with session/weekly quota bars and reset countdowns, a real-time activity log, and keyboard controls.

It falls back to plain log output when stdout is not a TTY (e.g. running as a service). Pass `--headless` (or `--no-tui`) to force plain-log mode from a terminal — useful for backgrounding the proxy.

### Session titles in the activity log

Claude Code sends `x-claude-code-session-id` with each request, so every activity row belongs to a known
session. The row is labelled with that session's name:

```
 ⠋ 17:42:57  adv-review-rewrite POST /v1/messages (claude-opus-5) → claude@rikbrown.co.uk (1.9s...)
 ⠋ 17:42:57  emmy-merge         POST /v1/messages (claude-opus-5) → claude@rikbrown.co.uk (0.4s...)
 ⠋ 17:42:57                     POST /v1/messages?beta=true (claude-opus-5) → claude@rikbrown.co.uk (1.1s...)
```

The name comes from Claude Code's own files under `~/.claude/projects`, in this order:

1. `<session-id>/custom-title.json`, written by `/rename`.
2. A `custom-title` record in the session transcript, which is the only copy for a session renamed before
   that file existed.
3. An `ai-title` record, the title Claude Code generates. Most sessions have one without a rename.

A session with none of these keeps the first six hex characters of its id. So does a request that carries no
session header: a bare SDK or API client reaches the proxy anonymously, and no file names it.

Each label is read once and re-read at most every 30 seconds, off the render path, so a `/rename` reaches the
log without a restart and no frame waits on the disk. Set `sessionTitles.width` to change the columns the
label gets, or `sessionTitles.enabled: false` to show ids only. See
[configuration](configuration.md).

Headless, you can re-sync accounts from the config without a restart by POSTing to the local control endpoint (the equivalent of pressing **R** in the TUI):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/teamclaude/reload
```

You usually don't need to call it directly. `login`, `import`, `enable`, `disable`, `priority`, `route`, `probe` and `warmup` notify a running server themselves.

Control-plane **writes** (`reload`, `switch`) are refused when the request carries a browser `Origin` or a cross-site `Sec-Fetch-Site`. Loopback is exempt from the proxy API key so the CLI needs no configuration, but that exemption also covers any web page you happen to visit: a page can POST to `127.0.0.1` cross-origin without a preflight, and while it cannot read the reply, the write would still land. `curl` and the CLI send neither header and are unaffected. Reads (`status`) are not restricted — the same-origin policy already stops a page from seeing the response.

Switching the account by hand has the same headless path — the equivalent of pressing **s** in the TUI and confirming with the default target selected:

```bash
teamclaude switch                 # list accounts, marking the current one
teamclaude switch me@example.com  # make that account the preferred one
```

Both forms need a running server: the choice is runtime state and is never written to the config, so there is nothing to apply on a later restart. The command wraps `POST /teamclaude/switch` with a `{"account": "<name>"}` body, and the account can be given as its display name, its bare email, its `accountUuid`, its `orgUuid`, or the fully qualified `accountUuid/orgUuid` — the last being the only form that tells apart one email that holds accounts in several orgs. The rotation index is deliberately not accepted — it is array position, so a script pinned to `1` would silently follow a different account after a removal.

As in the TUI, the choice is a weak preference rather than a lock, and it is worth knowing both ways it gets dropped. Rotation abandons it once the account becomes unusable (disabled, spent, throttled), and also whenever any available account carries a strictly lower `priority` value, since a higher-priority account preempts a healthy current one. A switch onto an account that cannot take traffic at all is still recorded, exactly as in the TUI, but the command says so instead of reporting a clean success:

```text
Switched to "me@example.com"
Warning: "me@example.com" is disabled, so requests will not route to it until that changes.
```

### TUI keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `s` | Switch active account (`←`/`→` picks the default account or a specific [route](routing.md#model-routes)) |
| `d` | Enable/disable an account |
| `p` | Refresh quota on all accounts (one-shot probe of the zero-spend usage endpoint) |
| `R` | Reload accounts from config |
| `g` | Settings (threshold, quota probe, routing, add/remove accounts, sx.org) |
| `q` | Quit |

In selection mode, use `j`/`k` or the arrow keys to navigate, `Enter` to confirm, `Esc` to cancel.

The settings screen is a list, not a set of letter shortcuts: `↑`/`↓` move between rows, `←`/`→` change the value in place (threshold by 1%, probe by 30s, modes cycle), `Enter` opens a row that needs typing or a sub-screen, `Esc` goes back.

## Run Claude Code through the proxy

```bash
teamclaude run
```

`run` probes the proxy first. If it's up, Claude Code is routed through it; if it's **not** running, `run` errors out rather than silently bypassing the proxy — which would spend your own quota with no rotation. Pass `--auto-fallback` to launch `claude` directly instead when the proxy is down:

```bash
teamclaude run --auto-fallback
```

Since **1.1.0**, `run` defaults to [MITM forward-proxy mode](proxy-modes.md#mitm-proxy-mode-default) so even hardcoded `api.anthropic.com` endpoints are intercepted. For the previous base-URL-only behavior, pass `--no-mitm`:

```bash
teamclaude run --no-mitm
```

Arguments after `--` go to `claude`:

```bash
teamclaude run -- --model opus
```

### Setting the environment yourself

`teamclaude env` prints the same export lines `run` uses:

```bash
eval "$(teamclaude env)"           # MITM: HTTPS_PROXY + NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS
eval "$(teamclaude env --no-mitm)" # base-URL: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL only
claude
```

Only the export lines go to stdout (so `eval` is safe); a short summary and any hints go to stderr. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is emitted — loopback clients are exempt from the proxy key gate, and setting it would drop Claude Code out of subscription mode. A remote (non-loopback) client must add the proxy key itself.

**Using an agent multiplexer or a tool that spawns `claude` itself?** Export this environment in the process that launches those `claude` instances — e.g. `eval "$(teamclaude env)"` in the shell you start the multiplexer from. Every spawned `claude` then gets the same routing (and MITM interception of hardcoded endpoints) without going through `teamclaude run`. The trade-off: `run`'s proxy-up/down guard only applies when you launch via `run`, so start the server before the multiplexer.

### Routing plain `claude` automatically

So you don't have to type `teamclaude run` every time, add a shell alias that sends plain `claude` through the proxy:

```bash
teamclaude alias              # print the alias for your shell
teamclaude alias --install    # or write it to your shell rc (--uninstall to remove)
```

This is an interactive-shell alias — it affects `claude` typed at a prompt, not `claude` spawned by editors or scripts. It's a thin passthrough to `teamclaude run`, which holds the proxy-up/down logic (so it errors when the proxy is down; add `--auto-fallback` to launch claude directly instead).

## Command reference

```bash
teamclaude login             # Add an account via OAuth (--api for an API key)
teamclaude import            # Import credentials from Claude Code
teamclaude server            # Start the proxy (--headless for plain logs)
teamclaude run               # Run Claude Code through the proxy
teamclaude env               # Print export lines for routing claude yourself
teamclaude alias             # Print/install a `claude` alias that routes via the proxy
teamclaude accounts          # List accounts with subscription tier and token status
teamclaude status            # Show live proxy status (requires running server)
teamclaude attach            # Open the live dashboard against a running server
teamclaude switch [name]     # Prefer an account; no name lists them (needs server)
teamclaude remove <name>     # Remove an account (by name or email)
teamclaude disable <name>    # Temporarily exclude an account from rotation
teamclaude enable <name>     # Re-enable it (also clears a stuck error state)
teamclaude priority <name> 1 # Set rotation priority (lower = preferred)
teamclaude route list        # Manage per-model routes (add/rm)
teamclaude probe 300         # Enable background quota refresh (off by default)
teamclaude warmup 600        # Enable keep-warm (off by default, spends quota)
teamclaude api <path>        # Call an API endpoint with account credentials
teamclaude update            # Check npm for a newer teamclaude and install it
teamclaude version           # Print the installed version
teamclaude help              # Show all commands
```

`teamclaude status` prints the same picture as the TUI, once, as text. Handy over SSH or in a script; `--json` for machine-readable output.

`teamclaude attach` opens the dashboard itself against a server that is already running, which is how you get interactive control back when the proxy runs as a background service. It polls the same status endpoint every second and can do the two things the control plane exposes: `s` switches account, `R` reloads config. Settings editing, quota probing and the request activity stream stay in the server's own TUI — they need state that only that process has. When contact with the server drops, the header marker turns from `▲` to `▼` and what is on screen is the last snapshot, not the current state.

## Auto-update

When TeamClaude is installed globally via npm, it self-updates in the background: it checks the npm registry at most once a day, and when a newer version is published it runs `npm install -g @rikcodes/teamclaude@latest` (this fork's package) and applies it on the next launch. The check runs after a `teamclaude run` session ends and when a headless server starts. A git checkout is never touched — update that with `git pull`. Run `teamclaude update` to update on demand.

Disable it with `TEAMCLAUDE_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE=1` or `"autoUpdate": false` in the config.

## Request logging

Log request/response details to a directory, one file per logged request:

```bash
teamclaude server --log-to /tmp/requests
```

Bodies are truncated past a size cap, and files older than the retention window are deleted — see [`logLevel`, `logMaxBodyBytes` and `logRetentionHours`](configuration.md#fields) to widen or disable them. The first start after upgrading sweeps whatever in that directory is already older than the window.

`--activity-log FILE` appends the TUI activity lines to a file instead, and works in headless mode too.

Claude Code's telemetry (`/api/event_logging/*`) is high-volume activity-log noise and is hidden from the log by default; see [`eventLogging`](configuration.md#fields) to block or show it instead.
