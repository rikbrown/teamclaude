// TeamClaude was built around one upstream (Anthropic), so the things that
// differ per backend — which host to reach, how to present the account's
// credential, which request paths belong to it — were inlined at the call
// sites. Adding a second subscription backend (OpenAI's Codex) makes those the
// axis of variation, so they live here instead.
//
// This is deliberately NOT a translation layer. Each provider is a passthrough:
// the client speaks that provider's own protocol and the body is forwarded
// untouched. All that changes is which account's credential is injected, and
// where the request is sent. Converting between provider protocols would mean
// re-serialising tool calls, streaming events and cache breakpoints, which is
// exactly the fidelity loss this proxy exists to avoid.
