 * Write a fatal error to `path` before the process dies.
 *
 * Node prints an uncaught exception to stderr and exits, which is invisible in
 * practice: the server runs under a full-screen TUI that repaints over the
 * stack, and stderr usually goes nowhere anyone kept. The one artifact that
 * explains a sudden exit has to outlive the process, so write it to a file.
 *
 * Handling these events replaces Node's own behaviour, so this must do what
 * Node would: report and exit non-zero. Continuing after an uncaught exception
 * would leave the proxy running on unknown state.
 * @param {string} path
 * @param {{ exit?: (code: number) => void, log?: { write: (s: string) => void } }} [opts]
