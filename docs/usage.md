# Usage

Running the server, running Claude Code through it, and the full command reference.

## Start the proxy server

```bash
teamclaude server
```

From a TTY this shows the interactive TUI: an account table with session/weekly quota bars and reset countdowns, a real-time activity log, and keyboard controls.

With accounts from two providers (Claude and Codex) and a terminal at least 127 columns wide, the account table is drawn as two panes side by side, one per provider, each titled with its provider. Each pane carries its own `►` current-account marker, because each provider pool keeps its own cursor. The panes are used only when both can draw every quota bar their rows have, so a fleet with per-model bars, route columns or blocked-family tags needs a little more than 127 columns; a narrower terminal keeps the single list, with the provider named in the type column (and still one `►` per provider). A Codex row whose subscription has reported a weekly window and no 5-hour one draws the weekly bar alone, at the width of both cells, while the Claude rows beside it keep `Ses` and `Wk`; a list made only of such rows drops the `Ses` column outright. An account that has not reported yet keeps both cells, and a row keeps them when its 5-hour window merely runs out.

It falls back to plain log output when stdout is not a TTY (e.g. running as a service). Pass `--headless` (or `--no-tui`) to force plain-log mode from a terminal — useful for backgrounding the proxy.

### Running in a container

A container image is published to GHCR on every version bump (`ghcr.io/karpeleslab/teamclaude`, tagged `latest`, `1`, `1.1` and the full version). It runs `server --headless` bound to `0.0.0.0` inside the container, so publish the port and bind-mount the config file:

```bash
docker run -d --name teamclaude -p 3456:3456 \
  -v ~/.config/teamclaude.json:/data/teamclaude.json \
  ghcr.io/karpeleslab/teamclaude:latest

docker exec -it teamclaude teamclaude login --token   # add accounts from inside
docker exec -it teamclaude teamclaude status
```

The entrypoint starts as root only long enough to match the runtime user to the owner of the mounted config (or of `/data` when the file does not exist yet), then drops privileges — so a file owned by your user stays writable without a `chown`. `TEAMCLAUDE_UID` (and optional `TEAMCLAUDE_GID`) override the detected owner. stderr is folded into stdout so `docker logs` shows one stream; set `TEAMCLAUDE_SPLIT_STDERR=1` to keep them apart. Auto-update is disabled in the image; pull a new tag to upgrade.

The config is created on first start with a random `proxy.apiKey`. Anything reaching the proxy from outside the container is a non-loopback client and must present that key (see [proxy.host](configuration.md#fields)); only `teamclaude` commands run via `docker exec` are exempt.

Build it yourself with `docker build -t teamclaude .` from a checkout.

### Session titles in the activity log

Claude Code sends `x-claude-code-session-id` with each request, so every activity row belongs to a known
session. With `sessionTitles.enabled` set, the row is labelled with that session's name:

```
 ⠋ 17:42:57  adv-review-rewrite POST /v1/messages (claude-opus-5) → claude@rikbrown.co.uk (1.9s...)
 ⠋ 17:42:57  emmy-merge         POST /v1/messages (claude-opus-5) → claude@rikbrown.co.uk (0.4s...)
 ⠋ 17:42:57                     POST /v1/messages?beta=true (claude-opus-5) → claude@rikbrown.co.uk (1.1s...)
```

The name comes from Claude Code's own files under `~/.claude/projects`, in this order:

1. `<session-id>/custom-title.json`, written by `/rename`.
2. A `custom-title` record in the session transcript, which is the only copy for a session renamed before
   that file existed.
3. An `ai-title` record, the title Claude Code generates. Most sessions have one without a rename.

A session with none of these keeps the first six hex characters of its id. So does a request that carries no
session header: a bare SDK or API client reaches the proxy anonymously, and no file names it.

Each label is read once and re-read at most every 30 seconds, off the render path, so a `/rename` reaches the
log without a restart and no frame waits on the disk. Only a session id shaped like a UUID is looked up, and a
title is printed with its control characters removed, since both arrive from outside the proxy.

This is off by default: it reads the tail of every visible session's transcript, which is further than the
proxy reaches for anything else unless asked. Press **g** → **Session titles** to turn the labels on and off
while the proxy runs. Set `sessionTitles.width` to change the columns the label gets. See
[configuration](configuration.md).

Headless, you can re-sync accounts from the config without a restart by POSTing to the local control endpoint (the equivalent of pressing **R** in the TUI):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/teamclaude/reload
```

The switch threshold has a control endpoint of its own — the same change as `teamclaude threshold 90`, and what the browser dashboard's **Switch at** control sends:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/teamclaude/threshold \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"percent": 90}'
```

It is a setting, not a nudge: the number is written to the config file (under its lock, so an edit the CLI or TUI made meanwhile survives) and the server reloads to apply it. The answer carries the stored ratio and, when one number replaced a per-bucket table, `dropped` names the buckets that went. Per-account `accounts[].switchThreshold` overrides are untouched. A request authenticated with a `proxy.clientKeys` entry is refused with 403 — a client key is a tenant of the proxy, not its operator; the shared `proxy.apiKey` and key-exempt loopback callers are allowed.

You usually don't need to call it directly. `login`, `import`, `enable`, `disable`, `priority`, `route`, `threshold`, `distribute`, `probe` and `warmup` notify a running server themselves.

Control-plane **writes** (`reload`, `switch`, `threshold`, `priority`, `disable`) are refused when the request carries a browser `Origin` or a cross-site `Sec-Fetch-Site`. Loopback is exempt from the proxy API key so the CLI needs no configuration, but that exemption also covers any web page you happen to visit: a page can POST to `127.0.0.1` cross-origin without a preflight, and while it cannot read the reply, the write would still land. `curl` and the CLI send neither header and are unaffected. Reads (`status`) are not restricted — the same-origin policy already stops a page from seeing the response.

`GET /teamclaude/quota` is the compact read endpoint for status-line integrations. It returns tier-weighted fleet aggregates and the underlying per-account limits; see [Fleet quota endpoint](quota.md#fleet-quota-endpoint).

Switching the account by hand has the same headless path — the equivalent of pressing **s** in the TUI and confirming with the default target selected:

```bash
teamclaude switch                 # list accounts, marking the current one
teamclaude switch me@example.com  # make that account the preferred one
```

Both forms need a running server: the choice is runtime state and is never written to the config, so there is nothing to apply on a later restart. The command wraps `POST /teamclaude/switch` with a `{"account": "<name>"}` body, and the account can be given as its display name, its bare email, its `accountUuid`, its `orgUuid`, or the fully qualified `accountUuid/orgUuid` — the last being the only form that tells apart one email that holds accounts in several orgs. The rotation index is deliberately not accepted — it is array position, so a script pinned to `1` would silently follow a different account after a removal.

As in the TUI, the choice is a weak preference rather than a lock, and it is worth knowing both ways it gets dropped. Rotation abandons it once the account becomes unusable (disabled, spent, throttled), and also whenever any available account carries a strictly lower `priority` value, since a higher-priority account preempts a healthy current one. A switch onto an account that cannot take traffic at all is still recorded, exactly as in the TUI, but the command says so instead of reporting a clean success:

```text
Switched to "me@example.com"
Warning: "me@example.com" is disabled, so requests will not route to it until that changes.
```

Taking an account out of rotation, or moving it in the priority order, has a headless path too — the web equivalent of `teamclaude disable` / `enable` and `teamclaude priority --first` / `--last`, and what the browser dashboard's buttons call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/teamclaude/disable \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"account": "me@example.com", "disabled": true}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/teamclaude/priority \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"account": "me@example.com", "place": "first"}'
```

`POST /teamclaude/priority` takes `{"account", "place": "first" | "last"}` or `{"account", "priority": <integer>}`; `POST /teamclaude/disable` takes `{"account", "disabled": true | false}`. Both accept an optional `"org"` (name or uuid) for an email that holds accounts in several orgs — an ambiguous name is refused rather than guessed. Unlike `switch`, these are config **writes**: the change is saved to the config file under the same lock the TUI uses, and the server reloads itself afterwards, so it survives a restart. `place` is relative — `first` lands one below the lowest priority in the fleet, `last` one above the highest — and the reply carries the account as it now stands (`{"ok": true, "name": ..., "priority": ...}` or `{"ok": true, "name": ..., "disabled": ...}`), so a caller learns the number it did not choose. An unknown or ambiguous account, or a priority that is not an integer, is a `400` with the reason; a write that landed but whose reload failed is a `500` that says so, since the file did change. A request authenticated with a `proxy.clientKeys` entry is refused with `403`: a client key is for using the fleet, not for changing which accounts it contains. Use the shared proxy key, or call from the proxy's own machine.

### TUI keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `s` | Switch active account (`←`/`→` picks the default account or a specific [route](routing.md#model-routes)) |
| `d` | Enable/disable an account |
| `l` | Sign an account in again via the browser (opens on the first account in `error`; not in attach mode) |
| `p` | Refresh quota on all accounts (one-shot probe of the zero-spend usage endpoint) |
| `R` | Reload accounts from config |
| `f` | Fleet view — cycles the pooled aggregate between **split** (beside the rows, the default), **full** (instead of the rows) and **off** |
| `g` | Settings (threshold, quota probe, quota-bar contents, routing, add/remove/reorder accounts, upstream and account proxies, sx.org) |
| `q` | Quit |

In selection mode, use `j`/`k` or the arrow keys to navigate, `Enter` to confirm, `Esc` to cancel.

### Fleet view

Past a handful of accounts the rows answer "what does each seat hold" when the question is "how much is left across all of it". `f` adds one block per backend, plus a line per route:

```text
  Fleet — Anthropic   9 seats · 7 counted
    Ses  ███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  11% · 4h12m  TTL 13h49m
    Wk   ████████████████████░░░░░░░░  68% · 1d22h
    F7   ██████████████████████████░░  91% · 13m
  Fleet — Codex   2 seats
    Ses  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0% · 2h30m
    Wk   ██████████████████░░░░░░░░░░  61% · 5d21h

  Routes   what stops each one first
    fable  F7  91%  13m  4 seats
    bulk   Wk  68%  1d22h  9 seats
```

Five things the block means, none of them obvious from the bars alone:

- **It is usable headroom, not raw quota.** Rotation stops using an account at the [switch threshold](quota.md#switch-threshold), and a [per-account cap](quota.md#per-account-usage-caps) stops it lower still where one is set. Each seat is measured against whichever of those is lower, so the bar reads 100% at the point every seat would be refused — not at the point the windows are literally empty. A single Pro account at 49% with a 98% threshold reads 50% here.
- **Seats are weighted by subscription size**, exactly as [`GET /teamclaude/quota`](quota.md#fleet-quota-endpoint) weights them: Pro and Team Standard count 1, Max 5x and Team tier 1 count 5, Max 20x and Team tier 2 count 20. A Codex seat counts 1 — ChatGPT publishes no tier to read, so one seat is one seat.
- **Disabled seats are excluded**, and so is any Anthropic seat on a tier this build does not recognise: its quota cannot be priced, and guessing would be worse than leaving it out. The heading says how many seats the figures cover (`9 seats · 7 counted`) whenever that is fewer than the pool holds.
- **A seat no [route](routing.md#model-routes) reaches is excluded too**, and counted in the same way. Quota nothing will send traffic to is not headroom, so a fleet whose routes name five of nine seats is measured on five. This errs towards saying you have less than you do: a model that matches no route at all still falls back to plain rotation, so such a seat does take unrouted traffic. Being surprised by exhaustion is the more expensive mistake. Where *no* route mentions a pool at all — the usual case for Codex, since routes are written about Claude models — the routing table is saying nothing about that pool rather than refusing it, and every seat in it counts.
- **Anthropic and Codex never mix.** They are separate subscriptions metering unrelated windows, so they get a block each; one averaged number would be true of neither.

The `·` tail inside each bar is that bucket's soonest reset across the counted seats. The `TTL` beside it is how long the pool lasts at its measured burn rate, and it is an *estimate*, not the warning an account row carries. A row tag speaks only when a bucket will stop you before it resets, or when it will expire wasting more than the floor; applied to a healthy pool that left every fleet line blank, which reads as broken rather than calm. A fleet line answers whenever a rate exists, and says which side of the reset it falls on with colour: yellow when the pool runs dry before it resets, grey when it lasts past it.

It draws on the same [burn-rate projection](quota.md#burn-rate-projection) sampler, so it needs about 90 minutes of samples before it appears and stays quiet after a restart rather than extrapolating from two readings. Enabling or disabling an account changes what the pool *is*, which resets that history too — and so does a route that stops reaching a seat.

**The route lines** answer a question the pools cannot. A route has no quota of its own: it spends its members' buckets, so a route holding three of nine seats is stopped by those three whatever the rest of the fleet has left. Each line names the one bucket nearest its ceiling — the constraint that will refuse the route's traffic first — with the percentage, that bucket's soonest reset and how many seats it is spread over. A Fable or Sonnet route is measured on its own weekly bucket **and** the shared weekly and session windows, because family spend meters into the shared weekly too: a route can be well under its `F7` cap and stopped by `Wk` all the same.

### Where the fleet block goes

`f` cycles three ways:

| State | What is on screen |
| --- | --- |
| `split` (default) | The rows on the left, the fleet panel on the right |
| `full` | The fleet block instead of the rows |
| `off` | The rows alone |

The split needs a terminal wide enough for both — about a hundred columns, and more for a fleet drawing Sonnet and Fable bars. The exact width is worked out from what the two sides need rather than fixed, so the panel never appears at the cost of a bar the account rows would otherwise draw. A narrower terminal shows the rows alone, and `full` is how you read the aggregates there.

Starting a selection (`s`, `d`) from `full` brings the rows back for as long as it is open, since the account table is the selection UI.

The view works when [attached](remote.md) to a server elsewhere, and the sidecar readout stays under the account rows either way.

The settings screen is a list, not a set of letter shortcuts: `↑`/`↓` move between rows, `←`/`→` change the value in place (threshold by 1%, probe by 30s, modes cycle), `Enter` opens a row that needs typing or a sub-screen, `Esc` goes back.

**Reorder accounts** opens the account list with the same two pairs of keys and one extra job for them: `↑`/`↓` pick the account, `←`/`→` move *that account* up and down the list, `Enter` or `Esc` goes back. Every move applies as you make it and is written a moment after the keys stop (or on leaving the screen), so there is nothing to confirm and nothing to cancel. An account moves among the accounts of its own provider: a mixed Claude and Codex fleet is drawn grouped by provider, so a move that would cross into the other group does nothing. This is the order the list is **drawn** in and nothing else — rotation order is [`priority`](routing.md#choosing-an-account), which the screen never touches. `teamclaude attach` draws the same order: each account in `/teamclaude/status` carries its `displayOrder` (`null` until it has been placed).

## Run Claude Code through the proxy

```bash
teamclaude run
```

`run` probes the proxy first. If it's up, Claude Code is routed through it; if it's **not** running, `run` errors out rather than silently bypassing the proxy — which would spend your own quota with no rotation. Pass `--auto-fallback` to launch `claude` directly instead when the proxy is down:

```bash
teamclaude run --auto-fallback
```

Since **1.1.0**, `run` defaults to [MITM forward-proxy mode](proxy-modes.md#mitm-proxy-mode-default) so even hardcoded `api.anthropic.com` endpoints are intercepted. For the previous base-URL-only behavior, pass `--no-mitm` — or set `defaultClientMode: "base-url"` in the config (the **Client mode** row on the TUI settings screen) to make that the default for `run` and `env` alike, with `--mitm` opting back in per launch:

```bash
teamclaude run --no-mitm
```

Arguments after `--` go to `claude`:

```bash
teamclaude run -- --model opus
```

**Claude Code still needs a login of its own.** In both modes the client checks its local login (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`, or the Keychain on macOS) before it sends anything, and the proxy only sees a request once that check passes. The pool's accounts do not stand in for it: they are what the proxy uses upstream, and the two expire independently. So a `claude` that exits at once with `Failed to authenticate: OAuth session expired and could not be refreshed` is reporting its own login, not the pool — run `claude auth login` and launch again. `run` prints a hint to that effect when `claude` dies within seconds of launch and the local login is missing or past its expiry.

### Setting the environment yourself

`teamclaude env` prints the same export lines `run` uses:

```bash
eval "$(teamclaude env)"           # MITM: HTTPS_PROXY + NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS
eval "$(teamclaude env --no-mitm)" # base-URL: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL only
eval "$(teamclaude env --mitm)"    # MITM regardless of defaultClientMode
claude
```

Only the export lines go to stdout (so `eval` is safe); a short summary and any hints go to stderr. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is emitted — loopback clients are exempt from the proxy key gate, and setting it would drop Claude Code out of subscription mode. A remote (non-loopback) client must add the proxy key itself.

**The proxy variables are shell-wide.** In MITM mode the eval exports `HTTPS_PROXY` and friends, and every other tool in that shell — `gh`, `git`, a package manager — follows them to a listener that only speaks to the providers' hosts; in a sandboxed shell that can surface as a synthetic 403 from an unrelated command. If that is your shell, set `defaultClientMode: "base-url"` (the **Client mode** row on the TUI settings screen): `env` then emits `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` only and, re-evaluated, unsets the proxy variables an earlier MITM eval left pointing at this proxy, leaving a real corporate proxy alone. `teamclaude run` scopes the variables to the `claude` process either way.

**Your own `NO_PROXY` is kept.** `run` and `env` both set `NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1` and append whatever the launching shell already had. That matters for local development: a dev server on a name like `app.test` resolves to 127.0.0.1 through a local resolver, and a forward to loopback is refused, so a client that proxied it would get a 403 on every retry. `export NO_PROXY=.test` before the eval (or before `run`) and the launched client gets `localhost,127.0.0.1,::1,.test`. The one entry that is dropped is `*` — it would send `api.anthropic.com` around the proxy as well, silently ending rotation; use `--no-mitm` for a direct launch.

**Using an agent multiplexer or a tool that spawns `claude` itself?** Export this environment in the process that launches those `claude` instances — e.g. `eval "$(teamclaude env)"` in the shell you start the multiplexer from. Every spawned `claude` then gets the same routing (and MITM interception of hardcoded endpoints) without going through `teamclaude run`. The trade-off: `run`'s proxy-up/down guard only applies when you launch via `run`, so start the server before the multiplexer.

### Routing plain `claude` automatically

So you don't have to type `teamclaude run` every time, add a shell alias that sends plain `claude` through the proxy:

```bash
teamclaude alias              # print the alias for your shell
teamclaude alias --install    # or write it to your shell rc (--uninstall to remove)
```

This is an interactive-shell alias — it affects `claude` typed at a prompt, not `claude` spawned by editors or scripts. It's a thin passthrough to `teamclaude run`, which holds the proxy-up/down logic (so it errors when the proxy is down; add `--auto-fallback` to launch claude directly instead).

```

`teamclaude status` prints the same picture as the TUI, once, as text. Handy over SSH or in a script; `--json` for machine-readable output. The JSON's `server.version` is the version of the process answering — read once at startup, so right after `teamclaude update` it still names the old code until the restart, where the installed CLI's `teamclaude version` already names the new one; `server.pid` is that process's id, so a caller can tell which server answered on a port. Each account's shared windows carry the time upstream last stated them, beside the value: `quota.unified5hSeenAt` and `quota.unified7dSeenAt`, in epoch milliseconds, for Claude and Codex accounts alike. Only a response or probe that states that window's utilization moves its stamp; a reset time alone, a failed probe or a model-scoped weekly bucket does not. (A Codex subscription states its only 5-hour window inside a model-named family; that reading is the account's 5-hour value, so it moves the 5-hour stamp.) The stamps survive a restart, and a value restored from a state file written before they existed reads `null` until upstream states it again, so `null` means "age unknown", never "just now".

`teamclaude attach` opens the terminal dashboard itself against a server that is already running, which is how you get interactive control back when the proxy runs as a background service. It polls the same status endpoint every second and can do the two things the remote control exposes: `s` switches account, `R` reloads config. The browser dashboard adds the matching **Reload config** action plus a zero-spend **Probe quotas** action; settings editing and the request activity stream still stay in the server's own TUI because they need state that only that process has. When contact with the server drops, the header marker turns from `▲` to `▼` and what is on screen is the last snapshot, not the current state.

`teamclaude service install` registers the proxy as a user service that starts at login and restarts on its own — a LaunchAgent on macOS, a `systemd --user` unit on Linux (`uninstall`, `status` and `print` round it out; `print` writes the unit to stdout without touching anything). On macOS the LaunchAgent runs with `ProcessType` `Standard`: the `Background` class it used before carried a QoS clamp that starved the proxy under host contention (status timeouts, seconds of event-loop lag). The unit is only written at install time, so an existing install keeps whatever it was installed with until you re-run `teamclaude service install`.

## Control routes under a second name

Every `/teamclaude/…` route the server exposes — `status`, `quota`, `reload`, `switch`, `disable`, `priority`, `threshold`, `probe`, `dashboard` and `mcp` — also answers at the same path under `/teamrouter/…`, with the same gates and the same replies. It is the first step of the [rename to TeamRouter](../README.md#renaming-to-teamrouter); scripts and dashboards written against `/teamclaude/…` keep working unchanged.

## Status dashboard (browser)

`GET /teamclaude/dashboard` serves a self-contained HTML page rendering the same data as `teamclaude status`: per-account quota bars (session and weekly, plus one bar per model-scoped weekly bucket upstream reports), rotation state, and active sessions — refreshed every few seconds.

`teamclaude dashboard` opens this page in the system browser against a running server (it starts none; use `teamclaude server` or `teamclaude service install` for that). The page's **Reload config** and **Probe quotas** buttons mirror the corresponding TUI actions without spending message quota. The **Theme** button cycles system → light → dark; the choice is kept in the browser's localStorage, and "system" follows the browser's `prefers-color-scheme`.

With `proxy.usageDimensions` configured, each dimension gets its own sortable table. With `proxy.sessionDetail` on, a per-conversation table shows each conversation's session, client, project, serving accounts, and what it actually spent per weekly bucket — cache reads and cache creation included — filterable by project or client. A client session that fans out to subagents is one row per agent: the rows carry the same **Session** and are told apart by **Conv**, a short digest of the conversation each one is (see [Session-aware routing](routing.md#session-aware-routing)). That table is off by default; see [Configuration](configuration.md#usage-dimensions).

A **Usage window** control sits above the Clients table and governs it and every dimension table under it. **Total** is the lifetime counter those tables have always shown; **Last 5h** and **Last 24h** show only what was spent inside that window. The tables re-sort on whatever window is selected, so the busiest client of the last five hours is the top row rather than the busiest of all time. **Last used** stays the lifetime figure under every window, since it answers when a client was last seen at all, which a window cannot. The figures come from `windows` on each client and dimension entry in `/teamclaude/status` — a rolled-up `{ requests, connections, inputTokens, outputTokens }` per window. The proxy produces them by tallying traffic into 15-minute slots and keeping only the slots the longest window needs, so a window covers its own length plus at most one slot, and the cost is set by the window rather than by uptime. The slots ride in the state file, so a restart resumes the windows instead of restarting them. A client or value with no traffic in any window carries no `windows` key at all rather than rows of zeros — the windows nest, so an empty longest window means every window is empty — which keeps the status payload close to its previous size on a dimension whose values are mostly stale. A consumer of `/teamclaude/status` should read an absent `windows` as zero in every window, and note that a proxy older than this feature omits it for the different reason that it has no windows to report. The control governs the Clients table and the dimension tables only: the Sessions table below them reports per weekly quota bucket, which is a different question and is unaffected by it. `5h` is the shared quota window. There is deliberately no 7-day window: the weekly quota is a bucket with a reset instant rather than a rolling window, so an honest weekly figure is "since the reset", not "in the last 168 hours".

A **warning banner** sits at the top of the page and is empty unless something is wrong. It reports a conversation that has had several client requests in a row come back with nothing usable — the case that reads as zero tokens exactly like an idle one, and is otherwise invisible — plus an account that needs a person (a broken token or a disabled entry). A spent quota bucket on **one** account, a rate-limit back-off and an upstream refusal are **not** reported: those clear themselves, and a banner that is always on is one nobody reads. When *every* account is over its threshold or in a hold, conversations do start starving — and the banner says which of the two it is, rather than blaming the conversation. Overage spend is not reported either: it is a month-to-date figure, so it would be lit for most of the month; the account card and `teamclaude status` carry it with the amount. With `proxy.sessionDetail` off the banner still fires, but names neither the session nor the conversation.

A **Routing** table above the accounts shows, for Fable, Sonnet, and any configured route, which account rotation would pick for a new request of that family and how many accounts could serve it — the ones that cannot are struck through, which is the reason the family is elsewhere. A pinned route names its pin, and says so when the pin is not eligible right now. The last rows are everything without a route of its own, one per provider in the fleet ("Claude default", "Codex default"): each names the server's default target for that provider, which is that provider's current account unless it is blocked or outranked, in which case the row says why. A Claude and a Codex pool keep independent cursors, so the summary line and the `current` badge on each card are per provider too. Targets are the server's own answers (`routes[].target`, `defaultTargets` and `currentAccounts` in `/teamclaude/status`; the older single-valued `defaultTarget` and `currentAccount` are still emitted. `currentIndexes` is `currentAccounts` by position: an object keyed by provider whose value is the current account's zero-based index into the status `accounts` array, or `null` when nothing can serve that provider — a name alone is ambiguous when two accounts share one, and it is what the attached TUI uses to place each `►`), not something the page derives from the quota bars; they describe a fresh request, not one a running conversation has already pinned elsewhere.

Each account card has a **switch** button that makes that account the current one (the same `POST /teamclaude/switch` the CLI uses). It is a nudge, not a pin: normal rotation resumes from there. What happens to traffic already running depends on `distributeSessions` — with it on, a conversation pinned to another account keeps it until it goes idle, so the badge moves before the traffic does; with it off (the default), everything follows the switch on its next request. The page reports whether rotation will actually use the target: a disabled, errored, rate-limited, or over-threshold account — or one outranked by a higher-priority account — is still switched to, but the page says so and why rather than reporting a bare "done".

A **Switch at __ %** control on the actions row sets the fleet-wide switch threshold, the utilization at which rotation leaves an account — the same setting as `teamclaude threshold <1-100>` and the TUI's settings screen, sent as `POST /teamclaude/threshold` with a `{"percent": 1-100}` body. Unlike the switch button this writes the config file and reloads, so it holds across a restart. One number replaces a per-bucket `switchThreshold` table, and the page says which buckets were dropped; per-account `accounts[].switchThreshold` overrides are untouched. The field follows changes made from the CLI, the TUI or another browser on the next poll, except while you are typing in it. A dashboard opened with a `proxy.clientKeys` key may not call it — the server answers 403, since a client key is a tenant of the proxy rather than its operator.

Beside it, each card has an **enable** / **disable** button (`POST /teamclaude/disable`) and, for an enabled account, **prioritize** and **deprioritize** (`POST /teamclaude/priority` with `place: "first"` / `"last"`). Unlike switch, these write the config file and reload the server — the same as `teamclaude disable`, `enable` and `priority --first` / `--last` — so they persist across restarts. A disabled account shows only the enable button: reordering an account that nothing will select is a control that looks like it does something and does not. The note under the cards reports the priority the account landed on, since a relative move picks a number the operator did not type. Both are refused when the page holds a `proxy.clientKeys` key rather than the shared proxy key; see the endpoint notes above.


```
http://localhost:3456/teamclaude/dashboard
```

The page is a static asset and loads without a key; the data does not — its script fetches `/teamclaude/status` first, and asks for the proxy key only if the server refuses the request without one. Loopback browsers are key-exempt as everywhere else, so on the proxy's own machine there is no prompt. A key that is entered is kept in the browser's localStorage, and a 401 after a key rotation brings the prompt back. On deployments that put the proxy behind TLS this works remotely too: `https://your-proxy.example.com/teamclaude/dashboard`.

## MCP endpoint

The running server can expose its control plane to Claude Code (or any other MCP client) as tools, so an agent can check the fleet's quota, switch accounts, or change a rotation setting from inside a session. It is off until the config says otherwise:

```json
{ "proxy": { "mcp": "read" } }
```

`"read"` serves `get_status` (the fleet at a glance: server version, current account, and for each account its priority, whether it is disabled, whether rotation can use it and why not, sessions and known quota windows), `get_quota` and `get_settings`. `"full"` adds everything the CLI's management commands can do: `switch_account`, `reload_config`, `probe_quota`, `set_account_enabled`, `set_account_priority`, `set_account_routing`, `remove_account`, `set_threshold`, `set_distribution`, `set_probe_interval`, `set_warmup`, `set_route`, `remove_route`, `set_blocked_models` and `set_client_mode`. There is no tool for adding accounts or handling account credentials, and none for changing `proxy.mcp` itself. `set_account_routing` does take a proxy URL with its password, and the write log prints that URL masked. `reload_config` re-reads the file and reports how many accounts it added and how many it removed: an account whose entry is gone from the file is dropped from the running fleet (see [accounts](accounts.md)). A reload picks the `proxy.mcp` setting up, so the endpoint can be opened, narrowed or closed while the server runs.

Point Claude Code at it once; `teamclaude run` and `teamclaude env` already keep loopback out of the proxy variables, so the connection goes straight to the server and is key-exempt like every other loopback caller:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http teamclaude http://localhost:3456/teamclaude/mcp
```

A client elsewhere on the network presents the proxy key the same way the CLI does: `--header "x-api-key: tc-…"`.

The endpoint is one more `/teamclaude/` route and is gated like the others: the proxy key or loopback, no cross-origin requests, and, for a caller admitted without a key, a Host header naming this machine. Three things follow from that. Every holder of any proxy key can read through it, but a named `proxy.clientKeys` key is served the `"read"` tools even when the setting is `"full"`: the write tools — removing an account among them — answer only to the shared `proxy.apiKey` and to key-exempt loopback callers, so handing a client its own key never hands it the fleet. With no proxy key configured at all, the endpoint serves only callers on the proxy's own machine (a loopback peer, no `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP`/`Forwarded` header, and `proxy.trustLoopback` not set to `false`) and answers 403 to everyone else; set `proxy.apiKey` to reach it over the network. And a browser-based MCP client cannot reach it, because it sends an `Origin` header and is refused as cross-origin; the endpoint is for clients that run as programs. Each write is logged by the server as one line naming the tool and the arguments.

It speaks both the stateless 2026-07-28 revision of the protocol and the handshake revisions before it, so a client on either works. Replies are plain JSON, never a stream.

## Auto-update

When TeamClaude is installed globally via npm, it self-updates in the background: it checks the npm registry at most once a day, and when a newer version is published it runs `npm install -g @rikcodes/teamclaude@latest` (this fork's package) and applies it on the next launch. The check runs after a `teamclaude run` session ends and when a headless server starts. In a headless server the install runs as a background child process, so the proxy keeps serving requests while npm works (a synchronous install used to stall it for the duration). A git checkout is never touched — update that with `git pull`. Run `teamclaude update` to update on demand.

Disable it with `TEAMCLAUDE_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE=1` or `"autoUpdate": false` in the config.

## Drain and restart

An update only takes effect on the next start, and restarting the proxy by hand means `ctrl-c` — which destroys every streaming response going through it, by design. `teamclaude server --supervise` makes the restart graceful instead: it runs the proxy as a child process and relaunches it whenever it asks to be restarted (exit code `75`). The ask comes from the TUI's `u` key, or, with [`autoRestart`](configuration.md#fields) on, from the server noticing a new build by itself.

What makes it safe to do while sessions are running is the **drain**. The server stops accepting new connections but keeps serving the requests already in flight, and every response it writes from that point carries `Connection: close` — so clients retire their pooled keep-alive sockets themselves instead of discovering them dead on the next request, which is what "a restart breaks my session" usually turns out to be. A request still running after 30 seconds is left behind and the restart proceeds: a stuck stream must not be able to hold a deployment forever. `ctrl-c` is untouched and still means stop now.

A supervised child comes up saying which build it came up on, and the terminal title carries it too (`teamclaude 2/4 work 1.1.20-rik.11`) — the title being the only part of a backgrounded window you can still read.

Neither `u` nor `autoRestart` does anything without a supervisor: exit 75 is a request, and with nothing waiting to act on it the proxy would simply stop. The TUI hides the `u` hint, and a server started with `autoRestart` set says so and leaves it off for that run. If you would rather supervise it yourself, export the marker and loop on the code:

```bash
export TEAMCLAUDE_SUPERVISED=1
while true; do teamclaude server; [ "$?" -eq 75 ] || break; done
```

## Request logging

Log request/response details to a directory, one file per logged request:

```bash
teamclaude server --log-to /tmp/requests
```

Bodies are truncated past a size cap, and files older than the retention window are deleted — see [`logLevel`, `logMaxBodyBytes` and `logRetentionHours`](configuration.md#fields) to widen or disable them. The first start after upgrading sweeps whatever in that directory is already older than the window.

`--activity-log FILE` appends the TUI activity lines to a file instead, and works in headless mode too. The flag lasts one launch; set [`activityLog`](configuration.md#fields) in the config to keep it across restarts.

Claude Code's telemetry (`/api/event_logging/*`) is high-volume activity-log noise and is hidden from the log by default; see [`eventLogging`](configuration.md#fields) to block or show it instead.
