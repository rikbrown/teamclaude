# Accounts

Adding, naming, and managing the accounts TeamClaude rotates between.

## OAuth login (recommended)

```bash
teamclaude login
```

Opens your browser and uses the same OAuth flow as Claude Code. Auto-detects the account email and subscription tier. Logging in with the same account again updates its credentials.

Run it once per account. You can add accounts while the server is running — press **R** in the TUI to reload.

If the profile cannot be identified, login stops without adding a placeholder
account. Retry after confirming the credential is valid, or pass
`teamclaude login --name <name>` to add it without profile detection.

## Import from Claude Code

If you already have Claude Code set up, import its credentials directly:

```bash
claude /login           # log into an account in Claude Code
teamclaude import       # import its credentials
```

Re-importing the same account updates its credentials. You can also import from a custom path:

```bash
teamclaude import --from /path/to/credentials.json
```

Automatic naming requires a successful profile lookup. If credentials are
invalid or the profile cannot be identified, the import stops without adding a
placeholder account. Pass `--name <name>` to explicitly import without profile
detection.

## Delegating credentials to a file (`importFrom`)

Instead of storing an OAuth account's tokens in `teamclaude.json`, an account entry can name the file to read them from:

```json
{ "name": "me@example.com", "type": "oauth", "importFrom": "~/.claude/.credentials.json" }
```

The tokens (`accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresAt`) are read from that file at startup and again on every config reload, so a login refreshed by Claude Code itself is picked up without re-running `teamclaude import`. Every other field on the entry (`priority`, `disabled`, `upstream`, `modelMap`, …) is kept as written. A file with no token skips the account with a message rather than sending an empty credential upstream. `teamclaude import` is the alternative: it copies the tokens into the config once.

## API key

For Anthropic API key accounts (billed via Console):

```bash
teamclaude login --api
```

## Multiple organizations

One email can hold multiple accounts across different organizations (e.g. corp + personal). Dedup is keyed on account + org, and names disambiguate as `email (Org)`.

Pass `--org <name|uuid>` to resolve a bare email when it is ambiguous:

```bash
teamclaude remove user@example.com --org Acme
```

## Managing accounts

```bash
teamclaude accounts             # list accounts with tier and token status
teamclaude accounts -v          # also show token expiry times
teamclaude remove <name>        # remove an account (by name or email)
teamclaude disable <name>       # temporarily exclude it from rotation
teamclaude enable <name>        # re-enable it (also clears a stuck error state)
teamclaude priority <name> 1    # rotation preference, lower = preferred
teamclaude priority <name> --first
teamclaude priority <name> --last
```

`login`, `import`, `enable`, `disable` and `priority` notify a running server to reload, so credential, priority and enable/disable changes are picked up live; the same reload (POST `/teamclaude/reload`, or **R** in the TUI) also applies hand edits to an account's `upstream`/`modelMap`. Account **removals** still need a restart.

Accounts can also be added, removed and reordered from the TUI settings screen: **`g`** → **Add account** / **Remove account** / **Reorder accounts**.

**Reorder accounts** sets the order the account list is drawn in — `↑`/`↓` pick an account, `←`/`→` move it up and down, each move saved as you make it. It writes a `displayOrder` on the entry and touches nothing else: an account keeps its place in the `accounts` array, so route pins, session pins and `TC_ACCT` all go on naming the same accounts, and rotation order stays `priority`'s business alone. An account with no `displayOrder` — every account, until the first time you arrange them, and every one added afterwards — lists after the ones that have one, which is where a newly added account appeared anyway.

## The `id` field

Every account entry carries an `id`, added the first time the config is read and written back on the next save. It is what ties an entry to the running account built from it: entries without a usable credential are skipped at startup, so an entry's place in the file is not the account's place in the fleet, and a token refreshed for one account would otherwise be recorded against another.

Hand edits are fine. Leave the `id` alone and it keeps working; delete it and a new one is issued on the next read. If you copy an account block to make a second entry, the duplicated `id` is spotted on the next read and the later of the two gets a fresh one.

## Codex accounts (experimental)

An OpenAI Codex subscription can be pooled alongside your Claude accounts.

```bash
teamclaude login --codex     # browser sign-in, repeat per account
```

Add `--no-browser` to print the URL instead of opening one, and `--name` to
label the account yourself (it defaults to the email on the login).

To pool a login you already have, or to add one without a browser, point an
account at the Codex CLI's own credentials file instead — it defaults to
`~/.codex/auth.json`:

```json
{ "name": "me@example.com", "type": "oauth", "provider": "codex" }
```

The Codex CLI honours `CODEX_HOME`, so several logins can be kept side by side
and pooled with `importFrom`:

```bash
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-second codex login
```

```json
{ "name": "second", "type": "oauth", "provider": "codex",
  "importFrom": "~/.codex-second/auth.json" }
```

Then tell Codex to reach TeamClaude instead of OpenAI, in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
model_provider = "teamclaude"

[model_providers.teamclaude]
name = "teamclaude"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3456/backend-api/codex"
wire_api = "responses"
```

### Through the MITM proxy (no Codex config needed)

MITM mode intercepts `chatgpt.com` as well as `api.anthropic.com`, so a Codex CLI
launched behind the proxy is pooled with no `~/.codex/config.toml` change at all:

```bash
eval "$(teamclaude env)"   # HTTPS_PROXY + NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS
codex
```

Two boundaries worth knowing:

- `chatgpt.com` is intercepted **only when a Codex account is configured**. An
  Anthropic-only fleet tunnels it untouched — intercepting a host nobody asked
  the proxy to read is not a neutral default.
- `ab.chatgpt.com` is never intercepted. It is OpenAI's telemetry endpoint,
  carries no inference, and there is nothing there to rewrite.

The base-URL route below still works and is the way to pool Codex without MITM.

`OPENAI_BASE_URL` does **not** work for this — a ChatGPT-authenticated Codex
ignores it. `model_providers` is the supported redirect.

The `/backend-api/codex` suffix matters. A Codex subscription authenticates
against the ChatGPT backend, not the OpenAI API platform — pointed at
`api.openai.com` the same token is refused with `Missing scopes:
api.responses.write`. Codex appends `/responses` and `/models` to `base_url`,
so this suffix makes it emit exactly the paths the ChatGPT backend expects and
TeamClaude forwards them verbatim.

### How it shares the port with Claude

One listener serves both CLIs, because the request path says which pool of
accounts is eligible: Claude Code posts to `/v1/messages`, Codex posts to
`/backend-api/codex/responses`. An Anthropic account is never offered a Codex
request and vice versa, so the two rotate independently on one port, one config
and one TUI.

### What differs from a Claude account

- The credential is injected as `Authorization: Bearer`, plus a
  `ChatGPT-Account-Id` header. That header is OpenAI's counterpart to the
  `account_uuid` TeamClaude patches into an Anthropic request body — so the
  Codex path performs no body rewrite at all.
- Tokens refresh against `auth.openai.com` using the Codex CLI's own client id.
- The request body is forwarded untouched. This is a passthrough, not a
  translation layer: TeamClaude never converts between the Anthropic and OpenAI
  protocols.

### Quota

Codex reports its limits on every response, and TeamClaude normalises them into
the same fields the Anthropic path fills — so the switch threshold, reset
countdowns and the TUI's quota bars work for Codex accounts too, and rotation
happens *before* upstream refuses rather than after a 429.

Two details are worth knowing if you read the raw headers:

- Limits arrive in families. The unnamed one is the account-wide limit; a family
  carrying `-limit-name` is model-scoped, the counterpart of Anthropic's Fable
  weekly bucket.
- `primary` and `secondary` are positions, not durations — the account-wide
  family can put its 7-day window in `primary` while a model-scoped family puts
  a 5-hour window there. Windows are classified by their stated
  `window-minutes`, never by position.

## Third-party backend accounts

Any Anthropic-compatible API can be added as an account alongside your Claude accounts. Give it a higher `priority` value (lower = preferred, so use e.g. `100`) and it will be used as a fallback when all Claude accounts are exhausted.

```json
{
  "name": "deepseek",
  "type": "oauth",
  "accessToken": "sk-your-deepseek-api-key",
  "upstream": "https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic",
  "priority": 100,
  "modelMap": {
    "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001": "deepseek-v4-flash",
    "claude-sonnet-4-6": "deepseek-v4-pro[1m]"
  }
}
```

- **`upstream`** — base URL of the target API. Requests are sent to `upstream + /v1/messages` (etc.) for this account only. One class of request is answered by the proxy instead of being forwarded — see [message threads](#message-threads) below.
- **`modelMap`** — when a Claude model name arrives in the request body, it is rewritten to the mapped name before forwarding.
- **`messageThreads`** — set to `true` when the backend keeps Anthropic message-thread state (a relay that reaches Anthropic does). Off by default for a third-party backend — see below.

Where the provider publishes one, its own balance or quota is shown in `teamclaude status` — see [third-party backend quota](quota.md#third-party-backend-quota).

Reserve the backend for sessions that explicitly ask for its models with a [route](routing.md#model-routes):

```json
{ "name": "deepseek", "match": ["deepseek-*"], "accounts": ["deepseek"] }
```

Then pick the model at launch, or with `/model` inside a session:

```bash
# This session routes to DeepSeek; all other sessions still use Claude accounts.
claude --model 'deepseek-v4-pro[1m]'
```

Model names with brackets (e.g. `deepseek-v4-pro[1m]`) must be quoted in the shell.

### Message threads

Claude Code keeps the conversation on the server once a thread exists: the first `/v1/messages` body carries `thread: {"type": "create"}` with the whole messages array, and every later one carries `thread: {"type": "continue"}` with only the new delta. A backend that keeps no thread state ignores the unknown field and answers the delta on its own, so from the second turn onward the model no longer sees the conversation — and nothing anywhere reports an error.

When a thread cannot be continued Anthropic answers `400`, and Claude Code resends the whole conversation rather than giving up (observed on 2.1.269). So the proxy answers a `continue` bound for an account with a per-account `upstream` with that same `400` rather than forwarding it. The body carries `details.error_code: "thread_unsupported_request"`, which the client reads as "this model keeps no thread state": it resends the turn in full and then drops the `thread` field entirely for the rest of the session, so the refusals are counted per agent and model rather than per turn, and cost no tokens. A session running subagents pays one refusal for the main agent and one for each subagent on that model. `count_tokens` is never refused: there is no conversation to resend for a token count.

The flag the client sets is keyed on the model, not on the account serving it. If the same model name is served both by a third-party backend and by Anthropic accounts, a refusal turns threads off for that model everywhere until the session ends — the conversation still works, it just travels in full each turn.

An `upstream` whose host is Anthropic's own is left alone without any flag — a region pin or a mirror reaches the real thread store, so there is nothing to repair. The host is what decides it: a third-party API serving the Anthropic shape does that under its own host.

Only a per-account `upstream` arms this. A fleet pointed at a third-party host through the global `upstream` is not covered, and there is no setting to turn the refusal on for it.

A relay that forwards to Anthropic does keep thread state, and for it the refusal is pure overhead — the client would re-send a full history each turn for nothing. Declare it with `"messageThreads": true` and continues are forwarded untouched.

### `accounts[].models` is deprecated

The older per-account `models` list still works, but use a [route](routing.md#model-routes) instead. Routes are more flexible (glob matching, multiple accounts, bucket override) and less surprising: a `models` list changes eligibility across the *whole fleet* — once any account claims a model, every account that doesn't claim it is skipped for that model. The server prints a deprecation notice at startup naming the route to replace it with, and the field may be removed in a future version.
