// Codex rate-limit reset credits.
//
// OpenAI occasionally grants a ChatGPT subscription a free "rate limit reset
// credit": redeeming one clears the account's spent rate-limit windows ahead of
// their own reset. Codex's own client offers it only as a manual action, so a
// pooled account that runs dry sits out the rest of its week with an unspent
// credit in hand — which is the whole reason this file exists.
//
// Same private ChatGPT backend as codex-usage.js, and the same isolation
// discipline: an account's credential is sent to the provider that issued it
// and nowhere else, so — like that file — nothing here knows an Anthropic path.
//
// Three facts about the wire format shape everything below.
//
// First, the COUNT is already in `/wham/usage`: that payload carries
// `rate_limit_reset_credits: { available_count, applicable_available_count }`
// at the top level, so reporting "this account holds a credit" costs no request
// of its own — the quota probe has already made it. That one field is parsed
// next to the rest of that payload, in codex-usage.js, rather than here: it
// belongs to the reading, and importing it back would put a cycle between two
// files that otherwise depend one way.
//
// Second, the detail rows (`GET /wham/rate-limit-reset-credits`) state
// `granted_at` / `expires_at` as ISO-8601 STRINGS. The Rust app-server layer
// states the same fields as epoch seconds; this is the HTTP layer, which does
// not, so the two must not be parsed the same way.
//
// Third — and this is the one that bites — the consume endpoint answers HTTP
// 200 on failure just as readily as on success, and puts its verdict in a
// `code` field (`reset`, `nothing_to_reset`, `no_credit`, `already_redeemed`).
// Classifying on the status code would read "you hold no credits" as a
// redemption that worked, and a redemption that worked is not recoverable.

 * Everything with a side effect lives here: the token refresh, the two HTTP

 *
 * There are two ways in, because a spent weekly window presents in two
 * different places and only one of them was ever wired up:
 *
 *  - `maybeRedeem(account)` — upstream rejected a request on THIS account.
 *  - `maybeRedeemForPool(accounts)` — selection refused a request before
 *    choosing anyone, because every Codex account it could have used is out of
 *    quota. This is the common case on a two-account pool and the one the
 *    feature exists for: no account is chosen, so no upstream 429 ever arrives
 *    and the first entry point cannot fire at all.
 *
 * Both run with a client waiting, and both must be safe under a burst — a spent
 * weekly window refuses every request in flight at once, and each of those
 * refusals arrives here asking the same question. Concurrent callers therefore
 * join one attempt rather than starting their own, per account and per pool.
 *
 * Joining only answers the triggers that arrive together, though; they also
 * arrive one after another. What bounds those is a fleet-wide hold, armed the
 * moment an attempt has spent a credit — or may have — and read before the next
 * attempt reads anything at all. It is deliberately not the per-account
 * cooldown, and not the per-account join either: a pool-dry attempt walks the
 * whole pool, so an account that has never touched the endpoint is just as able
 * to spend the second credit as the one that did.
 *
 * That waiting client is also what sets the time budget. The budget is ONE
 * deadline for the whole attempt (REDEEM_BUDGET_MS above), not a
 * timeout per call: what the waiting client can spare is a property of the
 * attempt, so each call gets whatever is left of it and never more, and a step
 * that finds nothing left does not run at all. Per-call timeouts would let a
 * refresh, a read and a POST each spend the full allowance and hand the client
 * a hold three times longer than anyone agreed to.
 *
 * The common path is one POST — the preconditions cost nothing and the rows are
 * cached — and every path that ends without a redemption, the exhausted budget
 * included, arms a cooldown and falls through to the ordinary rotation.
