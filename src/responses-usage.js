// Token usage as OpenAI's Responses API reports it, rewritten into the shape
// the rest of this proxy books.
//
// Every counter here — the account totals, the per-session ones, the per-client
// ones — speaks Anthropic's usage vocabulary, because that is the only shape
// this proxy had to read for its first year. Codex traffic is a passthrough, so
// it arrives in OpenAI's vocabulary instead, and the two disagree in a way that
// is easy to miss because they share field NAMES:
//
//   Anthropic   `input_tokens` is the UNCACHED input. The cached part is
//               reported separately (`cache_read_input_tokens`,
//               `cache_creation_input_tokens`) and the three are disjoint — the
//               readers here add them up to get a context size or a total.
//
//   Responses   `input_tokens` is the WHOLE prompt, with the cached part named
//               again underneath it as `input_tokens_details.cached_tokens`.
//               Booking it as Anthropic's would count the cached prefix twice
//               once the cache field is also read, and on Codex traffic that
//               prefix is most of the prompt.
//
// So the subtraction below is the entire point of this file: the cached tokens
// move out of `input_tokens` and into `cache_read_input_tokens`, leaving three
// disjoint figures that every existing reader already knows how to add.
//
// `output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` is NOT added to the output side —
// it is a breakdown of `output_tokens`, not a second quantity beside it (a real
// turn: input 54904, output 132 of which 18 reasoning, total_tokens 55036 =
// 54904 + 132). `input_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` is likewise left
// folded into the uncached remainder rather than mapped onto Anthropic's
// `cache_creation_input_tokens`: a cache write IS fresh input being processed,
// OpenAI does not bill it at a premium the way Anthropic does, and inventing a
// fourth disjoint bucket out of a field whose subset relationship is not stated
// anywhere would risk a total that no longer adds up.
//
// Shape confirmed against OpenAI's generated SDK types (`ResponseUsage`), the
// Codex CLI's own per-turn records, and the sidecar binary that translates this
// same body for the hop before us.

/** Terminal stream events, the only ones that carry a settled usage object.
 *
 *  Named rather than inferred from "the event has a usage object". A Responses
 *  stream mixes two kinds of event: the LIFECYCLE ones (`response.created`,
 *  `response.in_progress`, `response.queued` and the three below) each carry the
 *  whole response envelope, and therefore a `usage` key — null until the
 *  response settles; the rest, which is most of the stream, carry a fragment
 *  instead (`response.output_text.delta` carries a `delta` string, the
 *  `.added`/`.done` events an `item` or a `part`) and no envelope at all.
 *
 *  So matching the key rather than the name would make this proxy's accounting
 *  depend on the in-flight envelopes keeping `usage: null` for ever, and an
 *  upstream that began reporting progress figures would book one turn once per
 *  lifecycle event. Naming the terminal events keeps that decision here.
 *
 *  The names alone do not stop a terminal event arriving TWICE, so they are not
 *  the whole guard: the stream reader books the first one and ignores the rest
 *  (see `parseSSEDataLine` in src/server.js), because the account and per-client
 *  counters are incremental and would otherwise count the turn again.
 *
 *  `response.failed` is in the set because a failure that got far enough to
 *  report figures still spent them; when it carries none — the usual case — the
 *  normaliser below returns null and nothing is recorded.
