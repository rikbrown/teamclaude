 * The old wording — `All N accounts exhausted. Retry in 60s.` — was wrong in

 * (#168):
 *
 *   - N counted every configured account, including ones the operator had
 *     disabled. An account deliberately out of rotation is not capacity that
 *     ran out.
 *   - it never named the model, so a family-specific refusal (Fable spent,
 *     Opus fine) read as the whole proxy being out of capacity.
 *   - "exhausted" reads terminal while "retry in 60s" reads transient, so the
 *     operator retried by hand instead of looking at what was actually blocked.
 *
 * Counts only the accounts that were candidates, names the model when the
 * request carried one, and says plainly that the wait is until a window resets.
 *
 * "Candidates" was the word but not the behaviour: the count went on filtering
 * the whole fleet by `disabled` alone, so a `gpt-6-astra` request with three
 * accounts to its name reported all twelve as being at their quota — nine of
 * them Claude accounts it could never have used, and an operator reading that
 * goes looking for a fleet-wide outage. The set now arrives from the caller,
 * already narrowed (`candidateAccounts`), and is the same set the retry-after
 * beside it was measured from, so the number and the wait cannot disagree about

/**
 * How long before this request is worth sending again: the seconds that become

 *
 * It used to read three fields per account, and on a fleet of subscriptions all
 * three are routinely null — `quota.resetsAt` is set from the tokens/requests
 * headers an API key returns, and a subscription is metered by the unified
 * windows instead. So an account sitting at `unified7d` 1.00 with three days to
 * go looked like an account that knew nothing, every account did, and the
 * function fell through to its 60s default. The client honoured that default
 * forever: one silent retry a minute, a spinner, and no error ever reaching the
 * operator. Through a sidecar it compounded — the far hop answered 60s, the
 * near hop throttled its conduit account for that long, then read its own
 * throttle back and reported the same 60s upwards.
 *
 * Two rules keep the number honest.
 *
 * A window may only speak for a block it is imposing (`blockingResets`). A
 * 5-hour bucket at 12% that happens to refresh in four minutes is not why the
 * request was refused, and letting it answer would put the client back in the
 * one-minute loop wearing a different number.
 *
 * An account is blocked until the LAST of its blocks clears, so its own clocks
 * are taken at their maximum, while the fleet recovers when the FIRST account
 * does, so accounts are taken at their minimum. Mixing those up is how this
 * failure survives a half-fix: a spent ChatGPT account is usually throttled as
 * well, for the hour the 429 path clamps a relayed `retry-after` to, and
 * reading the sooner of the two would advertise an hour on a window with three
 * days left on it.
 *
 * Nothing known anywhere still means 60s. An account sidelined by a broken
 * token or a transport error carries no clock at all, and there is no honest
 * number to invent for it.
 *
 * Deliberately uncapped: the truthful value is the whole point, and a ceiling
 * would rebuild the silent loop at whatever interval the ceiling was. Nothing
 * downstream sleeps on it unbounded — the hold path clamps its own poll to 60s
 * and the inline retry only fires under INLINE_RETRY_AFTER_MAX_SECONDS, both of
 * which a multi-day value simply steps past. Exported for tests.
